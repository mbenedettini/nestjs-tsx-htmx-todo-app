# NestJS + Server-Side TSX + HTMX Boilerplate / Todo App

This is a simple todo app built with NestJS, Server-Side TSX, and HTMX that works
as an example or boilerplate for building full stack web apps using TypeScript
on the server side.

## Features

- NestJS
- HTMX + AlpineJS + TailwindCSS
- Add/Edit Todos using a Modal
- Server-Side TSX powered by [KitaJS](https://github.com/kitajs/html). If you are only
interested in this and you have an Express.js app you can just take `src/kita-views.tsx`
and add it to your project.
- Drizzle ORM + SQLite
- Zod for requests validation (see `src/zod-nestjs.ts`)
- A [Nix Flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) for development and building the project
- Linting and Formatting with [Biome](https://github.com/biomejs/biome)
- Optimized multi-stage Dockerfile (TODO)
